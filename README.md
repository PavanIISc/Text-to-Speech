Title: Spectrum lab TTS project

This project is an effort taken at Spectrum lab IISc to build a complete TTS system by considering Indian language database.

As a result a documentation has been prepared which drives anyone, who is having knowledge of minimum programming language, to build the system from the scratch. The document  includes step-by-step nstructions to build TTS system for Indian languages (Kannada, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil.). The same procedure could be used for other Indian Languges.

An HMM based model and STRIAGHT (Vocoder) for synthesis has been used. Some of my key contribution to the project includes:
Understanding the whole architecture and creating a modular code for facilitating research and development on signal processing aspects of speech synthesis.
Building the system using HTS and STRAIGHT vocoder.
Writing scripts to generate phoneme from Indian language transcripts.
An existing FLite integration for Indian Languages.
A clear documentation for building the TTS system from scratch for new languages.
